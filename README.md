# Histogram-Equalization-with-RGB
The histogram equalization (HE) is a technique developed for image contrast enhancement of grayscale images. For RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color images, the HE is usually applied in the color channels separately; due to correlation between the color channels, the chromaticity of colors is modified.Histogram equalization can be done in three steps: 
1.Compute the histogram of the image.
2.Calculate the normalized sum of histogram.
3.Transform the input image to an output image.
